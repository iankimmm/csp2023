	<h2>For our first project, my group created a taco stand. In this game, the plater is greeted and prompted
	    what type of tortilla they want, and what they want as their 2nd and 3rd fillings/toppings. The player 
	    must input their choice for the turtle to draw the toppings on the taco. At the end, you can choose 
	    whether to make another taco or quit the game.
